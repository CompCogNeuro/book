    Many of the individual differences in cognition, motivation, and learning\
    textemdash and the disruption of these processes in neurological conditions\
    textemdash are influenced by genetic factors. We provide an integrative synthesis across human and animal studies, focusing on a recent spate of evidence implicating a role for genes controlling dopaminergic function in frontostriatal circuitry, including COMT, DARPP-32, DAT1, DRD2, and DRD4. These genetic effects are interpreted within theoretical frameworks developed in the context of the broader cognitive and computational neuroscience literature, constrained by data from pharmacological, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and patient studies. In this framework, genes modulate the efficacy of particular neural computations, and effects of genetic variation are revealed by assays designed to be maximally sensitive to these computations. We discuss the merits and caveats of this approach and outline a number of novel candidate genes of interest for future study.

    cortex (areas 9 and 46)
  container-title: Journal of Comparative Neurology
  page: 360-376
  volume: '338'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: An understanding of the normal organization of prefrontal cortex is essential
    to the recognition of pathology underlying human behavioral disorders believed
    to depend on this region. We have therefore studied the pattern of intrinsic intra-
    and interlaminar pyramidal neuron connectivity in prefrontal areas 9 and 46 (of
    Walker) in macaque monkey cerebral cortex (anterior to the arcuate sulcus between
    the principal sulcus and midline). We made focal (200 $\mu$m) injections of biocytin
    and mapped the pattern of orthogradely transported label. Injections made into
    the superficial layers label wide-ranging lateral projections within the same
    areas of prefrontal cortex. Projections local to such small injections form a
    narrow band of terminals in layers 1 (200 $\mu$m wide, 2 mm long) centered on
    the injection site. Collateral fibers spread orthogonal to this terminal band,
    making frequent bifurcations, to establish a series of parallel bands of terminals
    with uninnervated bands between, spaced regularly across the cortex (center to
    center 500 $\mu$m). The entire pattern of terminal label is stripelike, with occasional
    narrower interbands and crosslinks between the bands, and can extend over 7 mm
    across the cortex. These projections arise from pyramidal neurons in layers 2,
    3, and 5 and terminate in layers 1. The stripelike pattern contrasts with patchlike
    patterns in other cortical regions (V1, V2, V4, motor, somatosensory) and is smaller
    in scale than stripelike zones of corticocortical afferent terminals to this region,
    reported to be 300 $\mu$m wide and spaced 1.0 mm center to center. 1993 Wiley-Liss,

  title: Inferring learning rules from distributions of firing rates in cortical neurons
  container-title: Nature Neuroscience
  page: 1804-1810
  volume: '18'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Information about external stimuli is thought to be stored in cortical
    circuits through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connectivity.
    These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal
    activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what
    plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the
    visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an
    area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one
    to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing
    rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low
    postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression
    from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing
    rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted
    from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of
    stimuli.

  title: A new neural framework for visuospatial processing
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  page: 217-230
  volume: '12'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The division of cortical visual processing into distinct dorsal and ventral
    streams is a key framework that has guided visual neuroscience. The characterization
    of the ventral stream as a ’What’ pathway is relatively uncontroversial, but the
    nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear. Originally proposed as mediating
    spatial perception (’Where’), more recent accounts suggest it primarily serves
    non-conscious visually guided action (’How’). Here, we identify three pathways
    emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal
    and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that
    courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial
    cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial
    processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation,
    respectively.

  title: Cellular Mechanisms of Long-Lasting Adaptation in Visual Cortical Neurons
    In Vitro
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 4286-4299
  volume: '20'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: The cellular mechanisms of spike-frequency adaptation during prolonged
    discharges and of the slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows, as occur
    in vivo with contrast adaptation, were investigated with intracellular recordings
    of cortical neurons in slices of ferret primary visual cortex. Intracellular injection
    of 2 Hz sinusoidal or constant currents for 20 sec resulted in a slow ($\tau$
    = 1 sec) spike-frequency adaptation, the degree of which varied widely among neurons.
    Reducing either \[Ca2+\]o or \[Na+\]o reduced the rate of spike-frequency adaptation.
    After the prolonged discharge was a slow (12 sec) AHP that was associated with
    an increase in membrane conductance and a rightward shift in the discharge frequency
    versus injected current relationship. The reversal potential of the slow AHP was
    sensitive to changes in \[K+\]o, indicating that it was mediated by a K+ current.
    Blockade of transmembrane Ca2+ conductances did not reduce the slow AHP. In contrast,
    reductions of \[Na+\]o reduced the slow AHP, even in the presence of pronounced
    Ca2+ spikes. We suggest that the activation of Na+-activated and Ca2+-activated
    K+ currents plays an important role in prolonged spike-frequency adaptation and
    therefore may contribute to contrast adaptation and other forms of adaptation
    in the visual system in vivo.

  title: Feature discovery by competitive learning\*
  container-title: Cognitive Science
  page: 75-112
  volume: '9'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: This paper reports the results of our studies with an unsupervised learning
    paradigm which we have called “Competitive Learning.” We have examined competitive
    learning using both computer simulation and formal analysis and have found that
    when it is applied to parallel networks of neuron-like elements, many potentially
    useful learning tasks can be accomplished. We were attracted to competitive learning
    because it seems to provide a way to discover the salient, general features which
    can be used to classify a set of patterns. We show how a very simply competitive
    mechanism can discover a set of feature detectors which capture important aspects
    of the set of stimulus input patterns. We also show how these feature detectors
    can form the basis of a multilayer system that can serve to learn categorizations
    of stimulus sets which are not linearly separable. We show how the use of correlated
    stimuli con serve as a kind of “teaching” input to the system to allow the development
    of feature detectors which would not develop otherwise. Although we find the competitive
    learning mechanism a very interesting and powerful learning principle, we do not,
    of course, imagine thot it is the only learning principle. Competitive learning
    is an essentially nonassociative statistical learning scheme. We certainly imagine
    that other kinds of learning mechanisms will be involved in the building of associations
    among patterns of activation in a more complete neural network. We offer this
    analysis of these competitive learning mechanisms to further our understanding
    of how simple adaptive networks can discover features important in the description
    of the stimulus environment in which the system finds itself.

  title: 'Making memories last: The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis'
  title-short: Making memories last
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  page: 17-30
  volume: '12'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis of protein synthesis-dependent
    long-term potentiation asserts that the induction of synaptic potentiation creates
    only the potential for a lasting change in synaptic efficacy, but not the commitment
    to such a change. Other neural activity, before or after induction, can also determine
    whether persistent change occurs. Recent findings, leading us to revise the original
    hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local, synapse-specific ’tagged’
    state and the expression of long-term potentiation are dissociable. Additional
    observations suggest that there are major differences in the mechanisms of functional
    and structural plasticity. These advances call for a revised theory that incorporates
    the specific molecular and structural processes involved. Addressing the physiological
    relevance of previous in vitro findings, new behavioural studies have experimentally
    translated the hypothesis to learning and the consolidation of newly formed memories.

  abstract: |-
    A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\

    textendash brain relationship. To solve these problems, neural and behavioral measures should be put on an equal footing. I illustrate this by an example from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent scientific definition of visual consciousness. However, to accept this definition, we need to let go of our intuitive or psychological notions of conscious experience and let the neuroscience arguments have their way. Only by moving our notion of mind towards that of brain can progress be made.

  title: Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as an effective description
    of neuronal activity
  container-title: Journal of Neurophysiology
  page: 3637-3642
  volume: '94'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines
    an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical
    findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple
    electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and
    apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our
    simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ($\pm$2 ms) of
    the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The
    model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity
    in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in
    shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has
    enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological
    classes described in vitro.

  title: 'Anatomy of hierarchy: Feedforward and feedback pathways in macaque visual
    cortex: Cortical counterstreams'
  title-short: Anatomy of hierarchy
  container-title: Journal of Comparative Neurology
  page: 225-259
  volume: '522'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'The laminar location of the cell bodies and terminals of interareal connections
    determines the hierarchical structural organization of the cortex and has been
    intensively studied. However, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of
    the connectional principles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. Quantitative
    analysis of retrograde tracers was used to extend the notion that the laminar
    distribution of neurons interconnecting visual areas provides an index of hierarchical
    distance (percentage of supragranular labeled neurons \[SLN\]). We show that:
    1) SLN values constrain models of cortical hierarchy, revealing previously unsuspected
    areal relations; 2) SLN reflects the operation of a combinatorial distance rule
    acting differentially on sets of connections between areas; 3) Supragranular layers
    contain highly segregated bottom-up and top-down streams, both of which exhibit
    point-to-point connectivity. This contrasts with the infragranular layers, which
    contain diffuse bottom-up and top-down streams; 4) Cell filling of the parent
    neurons of FF and FB pathways provides further evidence of compartmentalization;
    5) FF pathways have higher weights, cross fewer hierarchical levels, and are less
    numerous than FB pathways. Taken together, the present results suggest that cortical
    hierarchies are built from supra- and infragranular counterstreams. This compartmentalized
    dual counterstream organization allows point-to-point connectivity in both bottom-up
    and top-down directions.'

  title: Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain
  container-title: Nature
  page: 1102-1107
  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  abstract: |-
    Although the perirhinal cortex (PRC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) have an essential role in memory, the precise functions of these areas are poorly understood. Here, we review the anatomical and functional characteristics of these areas based on studies in humans, monkeys and rats. Our Review suggests that the PRC and PHC\
    textendash RSC are core components of two separate large-scale cortical networks that are dissociable by neuroanatomy, susceptibility to disease and function. These networks not only support different types of memory but also appear to support different aspects of cognition.

  title-short: The basal ganglia
  container-title: Progress in Neurobiology
  page: 381-425
  volume: '50'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon,
    and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture and
    movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the
    basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures, slowing of movement,
    involuntary movements, or a combination of these a abnormalities. However, it
    has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement.
    Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry, activity of basal
    ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have
    led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that
    the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement
    is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia
    act broadly to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere
    with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from
    the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit
    competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary
    muscle activity.

    In recent years, deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical survey compactly summarizes relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and Deep Learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning\
    & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.

  title: Slack, Slick, and Sodium-Activated Potassium Channels
  container-title: ISRN Neuroscience
  volume: '2013'
  abstract: The Slack and Slick genes encode potassium channels that are very widely
    expressed in the central nervous system. These channels are activated by elevations
    in intracellular sodium, such as those that occur during trains of one or more
    action potentials, or following activation of nonselective cationic neurotransmitter
    receptors such as AMPA receptors. This review covers the cellular and molecular
    properties of Slack and Slick channels and compares them with findings on the
    properties of sodium-activated potassium currents (termed KNa currents) in native
    neurons. Human mutations in Slack channels produce extremely severe defects in
    learning and development, suggesting that KNa channels play a central role in
    neuronal plasticity and intellectual function.

  abstract: One mechanism by which medial prefontal cortex (mPFC) exerts cognitive

    brake on behavior. Here the authors found increases in mPFC and STN theta power
    as a function of decision conflict. Increases in mPFC theta power predicted increased
    decision thresholds. STN deep brain stimulation reversed this relationship, resulting
    in impulsive choice.

  title: The What and How of prefrontal cortical organization
  container-title: Trends in Neurosciences
  page: 355-361
  volume: '33'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: How is the prefrontal cortex (PFC) organized such that it is capable of
    making people more flexible and in control of their behavior? Is there any systematic
    organization across the many diverse areas that comprise the PFC, or is it uniquely
    adaptive such that no fixed representational structure can develop? Going against
    the current tide, this paper argues that there is indeed a systematic organization
    across PFC areas, with an important functional distinction between ventral and
    dorsal regions characterized as processing What versus How information, respectively.
    This distinction has implications for the rostro-caudal and medial–lateral axes
    of organization as well. The resulting large-scale functional map of PFC could
    prove useful in integrating diverse data, and in generating novel predictions.

  title: Structural plasticity of dendritic spines
  container-title: Current Opinion in Neurobiology
  collection-title: Synaptic structure and function
  page: 383-388
  volume: '22'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Dendritic spines are small mushroom-like protrusions arising from neurons
    where most excitatory synapses reside. Their peculiar shape suggests that spines
    can serve as an autonomous postsynaptic compartment that isolates chemical and
    electrical signaling. How neuronal activity modifies the morphology of the spine
    and how these modifications affect synaptic transmission and plasticity are intriguing
    issues. Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD)
    is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine, respectively. This
    structural plasticity is mainly controlled by actin filaments, the principal cytoskeletal
    component of the spine. Here we review the pioneering microscopic studies examining
    the structural plasticity of spines and propose how changes in actin treadmilling
    might regulate spine morphology.

  volume: '97'

  abstract: Recent sensory experience affects both perception and the response properties
    of visual neurons. Here I review a rapid form of experience-dependent plasticity
    that follows adaptation, the presentation of a particular stimulus or ensemble
    of stimuli for periods ranging from tens of milliseconds to minutes. Adaptation
    has a rich history in psychophysics, where it is often used as a tool for dissecting
    the perceptual mechanisms of vision. Although we know comparatively little about
    the neurophysiological effects of adaptation, work in the last decade has revealed
    a rich repertoire of effects. This review focuses on this recent physiological
    work, the cellular and biophysical mechanisms that may underlie the observed effects,
    and the functional benefit that they may afford. I conclude with a brief discussion
    of some important open questions in the field.

  title: 'Synaptic modifications in cultured hippocampal neurons: Dependence on spike
    timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type'
  title-short: Synaptic modifications in cultured hippocampal neurons
  container-title: The Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 10464-10472
  volume: '18'
  issue: '24'
  abstract: In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation
    and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of
    presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic
    and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes.
    Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic
    activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking
    within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to
    long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively
    low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence
    on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation
    of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were
    GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished
    the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the
    importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type
    in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s
    rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that
    reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.

  container-title: The Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 3310-3323
  volume: '28'

  abstract: 'Spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) plays an important
    role in neural development and information processing in the brain; however, the
    mechanism by which spike timing information is encoded into STDP remains unclear.
    Here, we show that a novel allosteric kinetics of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is required
    for STDP. We developed a detailed biophysical model of STDP and found thatthemodelrequiredspiketiming-dependentdistinctsuppressionofNMDARsbyCa20̎010fc00-calmodulin.Thisledustopredictanallosteric

    with prespiking 3 postspiking and postspiking 3 prespiking, respectively. We found
    that the allosteric kinetics, but not the conventional kinetics, is consistent
    with specific features of amplitudes and peak time of NMDAR-mediated EPSPs in
    experiments. We found that the allosteric kinetics of NMDARs was also valid for
    synaptic plasticity induced by more complex spike trains in layer II/III of visual
    cortex. We extracted an essential synaptic learning rule by reduction of the allosteric
    STDP model and found that spike timing-dependent bidirectional role of postspiking
    in synaptic modifi- cation, which depends on the allosteric kinetics, is the essential
    principle in STDP. Thus, we propose a simple hypothesis of the allosteric kinetics
    of NMDARs that can coherently explain critical features of spike timing-dependent
    NMDAR-mediated EPSPs and synaptic plasticity.'

  abstract: A single neuron with Hebbian-type learning for the connection weights,
    and with nonlinear internal feedback, has been shown to extract the statistical
    principal components of its stationary input pattern sequence. A generalization
    of this model to a layer of neuron units is given, called the Subspace Network,
    which yields a multi-dimensional, principal component subspace. This can be used
    as an associative memory for the input vectors or as a module in nonsupervised
    learning of data clusters in the input space. It is also able to realize a powerful
    pattern classifier based on projections on class subspaces. Some classification
    results for natural textures are given.

  title: 'Deep predictive learning: A comprehensive model of three visual streams'
  title-short: Deep Predictive Learning
  container-title: arXiv:1709.04654 \[q-bio\]
  abstract: 'How does the neocortex learn and develop the foundations of all our high-level
    cognitive abilities? We present a comprehensive framework spanning biological,
    computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical continuity between
    levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by extensive data at each
    level. Learning is based on making predictions about what the senses will report
    at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and adapting synaptic weights to improve
    prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus serves as a projection
    screen upon which predictions are generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic
    inputs from multiple brain areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving
    inputs from layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and
    the temporal difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout
    the cortex, driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using
    only local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed biophysical
    model. In vision, predictive learning requires a carefully-organized developmental
    progression and anatomical organization of three pathways (What, Where, and What
    \* Where), according to two central principles: top-down input from compact, high-level,
    abstract representations is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory
    inputs; and the collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
    opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that drive
    the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized systematic
    invariant object representations of 100 different objects from simple movies,
    accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable predictions.'

  title: Striatal D1 and D2 signaling differentially predict learning from positive
    and negative outcomes
  container-title: NeuroImage
  page: 95-101
  volume: '109'
  abstract: The extent to which we learn from positive and negative outcomes of decisions
    is modulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine neurons burst fire in
    response to unexpected rewards and pause following negative outcomes. This dual
    signaling mechanism is hypothesized to drive both approach and avoidance behavior.
    Here we test a prediction deriving from a computational reinforcement learning
    model, in which approach is mediated via activation of the direct cortico-striatal
    pathway due to striatal D1 receptor stimulation, while avoidance occurs via disinhibition
    of indirect pathway striatal neurons secondary to a reduction of D2 receptor stimulation.
    Using positron emission tomography with two separate radioligands, we demonstrate
    that individual differences in human approach and avoidance learning are predicted
    by variability in striatal D1 and D2 receptor binding, respectively. Moreover,
    transient dopamine precursor depletion improved learning from negative outcomes.
    These findings support a bidirectional modulatory role for striatal dopamine in
    reward and avoidance learning via segregated D1 and D2 cortico-striatal pathways.

  title: Nucleus accumbens D2R cells signal prior outcomes and control risky decision-making
  container-title: Nature
  page: 642-646
  volume: '531'
  issue: '7596'
  abstract: A marked bias towards risk aversion has been observed in nearly every
    species tested. A minority of individuals, however, instead seem to prefer risk
    (repeatedly choosing uncertain large rewards over certain but smaller rewards),
    and even risk-averse individuals sometimes opt for riskier alternatives. It is
    not known how neural activity underlies such important shifts in decision-making—either
    as a stable trait across individuals or at the level of variability within individuals.
    Here we describe a model of risk-preference in rats, in which stable individual
    differences, trial-by-trial choices, and responses to pharmacological agents all
    parallel human behaviour. By combining new genetic targeting strategies with optical
    recording of neural activity during behaviour in this model, we identify relevant
    temporally specific signals from a genetically and anatomically defined population
    of neurons. This activity occurred within dopamine receptor type-2 (D2R)-expressing
    cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), signalled unfavourable outcomes from the
    recent past at a time appropriate for influencing subsequent decisions, and also
    predicted subsequent choices made. Having uncovered this naturally occurring neural
    correlate of risk selection, we then mimicked the temporally specific signal with
    optogenetic control during decision-making and demonstrated its causal effect
    in driving risk-preference. Specifically, risk-preferring rats could be instantaneously
    converted to risk-averse rats with precisely timed phasic stimulation of NAc D2R
    cells. These findings suggest that individual differences in risk-preference,
    as well as real-time risky decision-making, can be largely explained by the encoding
    in D2R-expressing NAc cells of prior unfavourable outcomes during decision-making.

    and AMPA receptors'
  title-short: Variation in the persistence of memory
  container-title: Brain Research
  collection-title: 'Brain and Memory: Old Arguments and New Perspectives'
  page: 29-37
  volume: '1621'
  abstract: 'William James noted that memories could persist from minutes to weeks.
    This essay attempts to explain this variation by situating the explanation in
    the biochemistry of dendritic spines. Two outcomes are critical to generate the
    synaptic basis of memory: (1) the actin cytoskeleton in the spine must be degraded
    to permit (2) additional AMPA receptors (GluA1s) to enter new “hot spots” in the
    postsynaptic density. These initial outcomes can support short-lasting memories.
    The threshold for these events is low but the underlying synaptic changes cannot
    resist the endocytic processes that remove the added AMPA receptors. For the memory
    to persist the degraded actin cytoskeleton must be rebuilt and the vacated “hot
    spots” refilled with GluA2 receptors. A primary claim is that it is the stabilization
    of an enlarged actin cytoskeleton that is the target outcome that consolidates
    the synaptic basis of memory (see Lynch et al., 2007). The stabilized actin cytoskeleton
    has properties that enable it to garner the synaptic proteins it needs to self
    sustain the potentiated state and to benefit from activation of memory modulation
    systems. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brain and Memory.'

  title: Neural signature of hierarchically structured expectations predicts clustering
    and transfer of rule sets in reinforcement learning
  container-title: Cognition
  page: 160-169
  volume: '152'
  abstract: Often the world is structured such that distinct sensory contexts signify
    the same abstract rule set. Learning from feedback thus informs us not only about
    the value of stimulus-action associations but also about which rule set applies.
    Hierarchical clustering models suggest that learners discover structure in the
    environment, clustering distinct sensory events into a single latent rule set.
    Such structure enables a learner to transfer any newly acquired information to
    other contexts linked to the same rule set, and facilitates re-use of learned
    knowledge in novel contexts. Here, we show that humans exhibit this transfer,
    generalization and clustering during learning. Trial-by-trial model-based analysis
    of EEG signals revealed that subjects’ reward expectations incorporated this hierarchical
    structure; these structured neural signals were predictive of behavioral transfer
    and clustering. These results further our understanding of how humans learn and
    generalize flexibly by building abstract, behaviorally relevant representations
    of the complex, high-dimensional sensory environment.

  title-short: Nonmonotonic Plasticity
  container-title: Trends in Cognitive Sciences
  page: 726-742
  volume: '23'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: What are the principles that govern whether neural representations move
    apart (differentiate) or together (integrate) as a function of learning? According
    to supervised learning models that are trained to predict outcomes in the world,
    integration should occur when two stimuli predict the same outcome. Numerous findings
    support this, but paradoxically some recent fMRI studies have found that pairing
    different stimuli with the same associate causes differentiation, not integration.
    To explain these and related findings, we argue that supervised learning needs
    to be supplemented with unsupervised learning that is driven by spreading activation
    in a U-shaped way, such that inactive memories are not modified, moderate activation
    of memories causes weakening (leading to differentiation), and higher activation
    causes strengthening (leading to integration).

  title: A systems-neuroscience model of phasic dopamine
  abstract: We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of the phasic
    dopamine signal- ing system that can account for a wider range of phenomena than
    simpler reward prediction error (RPE) accounts. The central feature of this PVLV
    framework is the distinction between a Primary Value (PV) system for anticipating
    the onset of primary rewards (USs), and a Learned Value (LV) system for learning
    about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system corresponds to
    the amygdala and its ability to drive phasic dopamine bursting in midbrain dopamine
    areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum (principally the nucleus
    accumbens, NAc), which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs
    (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the
    lateral habenula, LHb). We show how our model can account for a range of data
    supporting the separability of these systems, including the non-zero- sum nature
    of CS and US firing, and individual differences in CS-based learning (sign-tracking)
    vs. US-based learning (goal-tracking). A critical feature of both systems is the
    use of opponent- processing pathways that represent the competing strengths of
    the evidence in favor and opposed to specific USs, and we show how these pathways
    can explain a range of important data dissociat- ing the processes involved in
    acquisition vs. extinction conditioning, including rapid reaquisition, reinstatement,
    and renewal. Furthermore, this opponent structure is critical for being able to
    ac- count for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the surprisingly
    closely-related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional
    separable pathways rep- resenting aversive USs, which largely mirror those for
    appetitive USs, also have some important differences from the positive valence
    case, which allow the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive
    conditioning. Overall, the ability to account for all of these phenomena strongly
    constrains the form of the model, which thus provides a well-validated framework
    for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.

  abstract: 'The frontal lobes may be organized hierarchically such that more rostral
    frontal regions modulate cognitive control operations in caudal regions. In our
    companion paper (Frank MJ, Badre D. 2011. Mechanisms of hierarchical reinforcement
    learning in corticostriatal circuits I: computational analysis. 22:509–526), we
    provide novel neural circuit and algorithmic models of hierarchical cognitive
    control in cortico–striatal circuits. Here, we test key model predictions using
    functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our neural circuit model proposes
    that contextual representations in rostral frontal cortex influence the striatal
    gating of contextual representations in caudal frontal cortex. Reinforce- ment
    learning operates at each level, such that the system adaptively learns to gate
    higher order contextual information into rostral regions. Our algorithmic Bayesian
    “mixture of experts” model captures the key computations of this neural model
    and provides trial-by-trial estimates of the learner’s latent hypothesis states.
    In the present paper, we used these quantitative estimates to reanalyze fMRI data
    from a hierarchical reinforcement learning task reported in Badre D, Kayser AS,
    D’Esposito M. 2010. Frontal cortex and the discovery of abstract action rules.
    Neuron. 66:315 326. Results validate key predictions of the models and provide
    evidence for an individual cortico–striatal circuit for reinforcement learning

    are initially consistent with the proposal that hierarchical control in frontal
    cortex may emerge from interactions among nested cortico–striatal circuits at
    different levels of abstraction. Keywords: basal ganglia, cognitive control, fMRI,

  abstract: Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple

    These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition,
    visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug
    discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data
    sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change
    its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer
    from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought
    about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent
    nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.

  title: Linear Versus Nonlinear Signal Transmission in Neuron Models With Adaptation
    Currents or Dynamic Thresholds
  container-title: Journal of Neurophysiology
  page: 2806-2820
  volume: '104'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent aspect of neuronal dynamics
    that shapes a neuron’s signal processing properties on timescales ranging from
    about 10 ms to $>$1 s. For integrate-and-fire model neurons spike-frequency adaptation
    is incorporated either as an adaptation current or as a dynamic firing threshold.
    Whether a physiologically observed adaptation mechanism should be modeled as an
    adaptation current or a dynamic threshold, however, is not known. Here we show
    that a dynamic threshold has a divisive effect on the onset fI curve (the initial
    maximal firing rate following a step increase in an input current) measured at
    increasing mean threshold levels, i.e., adaptation states. In contrast, an adaptation
    current subtractively shifts this fI curve to higher inputs without affecting
    its slope. As a consequence, an adaptation current acts essentially linearly,
    resulting in a high-pass filter component of the neuron’s transfer function for
    current stimuli. With a dynamic threshold, however, the transfer function strongly
    depends on the input range because of the multiplicative effect on the fI curves.
    Simulations of conductance-based spiking models with adaptation currents, such
    as afterhyperpolarization (AHP)-type, M-type, and sodium-activated potassium currents,
    do not show the divisive effects of a dynamic threshold, but agree with the properties
    of integrate-and-fire neurons with adaptation current. Notably, the effects of
    slow inactivation of sodium currents cannot be reproduced by either model. Our
    results suggest that, when lateral shifts of the onset fI curve are seen in response
    to adapting inputs, adaptation should be modeled with adaptation currents and
    not with a dynamic threshold. In contrast, when the slope of onset fI curves depends
    on the adaptation state, then adaptation should be modeled with a dynamic threshold.
    Further, the observation of divisively altered onset fI curves in adapted neurons
    with notable variability of their spike threshold could hint to yet known biophysical
    mechanisms directly affecting the threshold.

  abstract: In this article we develop the concept that the hippo- campus and the
    midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form a functional
    loop. Activation of the loop begins when the hippo- campus detects newly arrived
    information that is not already stored in its long-term memory. The resulting
    novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum
    to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal informa- tion) to
    the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine
    (DA) is re- leased within the hippocampus; this produces an en- hancement of LTP
    and learning. These findings sup- port a model whereby the hippocampal-VTA loop
    regulates the entry of information into long-term memory.

  title: 'Simple Memory: A Theory for Archicortex'
  title-short: Simple Memory
  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 23-81
  volume: '262'
  issue: '841'
  abstract: It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is
    its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
    general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models
    for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex.
    The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation,
    which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about
    200 out of a population of 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ cells. It is shown
    that if about 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ simple representations are
    stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt
    event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is
    made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions
    are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive
    theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given
    of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum,
    the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
    number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification
    of typical archicortical cells is proposed.
