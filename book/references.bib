These channels are activated by elevations in intracellular sodium, such as those that occur during trains of one or more action potentials, or following activation of nonselective cationic neurotransmitter receptors such as AMPA receptors. This review covers the cellular and molecular properties of Slack and Slick channels and compares them with findings on the properties of sodium-activated potassium currents (termed KNa currents) in native neurons. Human mutations in Slack channels produce extremely severe defects in learning and development, suggesting that KNa channels play a central role in neuronal plasticity and intellectual function.",

These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of stimuli.",

According to supervised learning models that are trained to predict outcomes in the world, integration should occur when two stimuli predict the same outcome. Numerous findings support this, but \textendash{} paradoxically \textendash{} some recent fMRI studies have found that pairing different stimuli with the same associate causes differentiation, not integration. To explain these and related findings, we argue that supervised learning needs to be supplemented with unsupervised learning that is driven by spreading activation in a U-shaped way, such that inactive memories are not modified, moderate activation of memories causes weakening (leading to differentiation), and higher activation causes strengthening (leading to integration).},

Dopamine neurons burst fire in response to unexpected rewards and pause following negative outcomes. This dual signaling mechanism is hypothesized to drive both approach and avoidance behavior. Here we test a prediction deriving from a computational reinforcement learning model, in which approach is mediated via activation of the direct cortico-striatal pathway due to striatal D1 receptor stimulation, while avoidance occurs via disinhibition of indirect pathway striatal neurons secondary to a reduction of D2 receptor stimulation. Using positron emission tomography with two separate radioligands, we demonstrate that individual differences in human approach and avoidance learning are predicted by variability in striatal D1 and D2 receptor binding, respectively. Moreover, transient dopamine precursor depletion improved learning from negative outcomes. These findings support a bidirectional modulatory role for striatal dopamine in reward and avoidance learning via segregated D1 and D2 cortico-striatal pathways.",

The resulting novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal informa- tion) to the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine (DA) is re- leased within the hippocampus; this produces an en- hancement of LTP and learning.

Intracellular injection of 2 Hz sinusoidal or constant currents for 20 sec resulted in a slow ({$\tau$} = 1\textendash{}10 sec) spike-frequency adaptation, the degree of which varied widely among neurons. Reducing either [Ca2+]o or [Na+]o reduced the rate of spike-frequency adaptation. After the prolonged discharge was a slow (12\textendash{}75 sec) AHP that was associated with an increase in membrane conductance and a rightward shift in the discharge frequency versus injected current relationship. The reversal potential of the slow AHP was sensitive to changes in [K+]o, indicating that it was mediated by a K+ current. Blockade of transmembrane Ca2+ conductances did not reduce the slow AHP. In contrast, reductions of [Na+]o reduced the slow AHP, even in the presence of pronounced Ca2+ spikes. We suggest that the activation of Na+-activated and Ca2+-activated K+ currents plays an important role in prolonged spike-frequency adaptation and therefore may contribute to contrast adaptation and other forms of adaptation in the visual system in vivo.},

    abstract  = "This paper reports the results of our studies with an unsupervised learning paradigm which we have called ``Competitive Learning.'' We have examined competitive learning using both computer simulation and formal analysis and have found that when it is applied to parallel networks of neuron-like elements, many potentially useful learning tasks can be accomplished. We were attracted to competitive learning because it seems to provide a way to discover the salient, general features which can be used to classify a set of patterns. We show how a very simply competitive mechanism can discover a set of feature detectors which capture important aspects of the set of stimulus input patterns. We also show how these feature detectors can form the basis of a multilayer system that can serve to learn categorizations of stimulus sets which are not linearly separable. We show how the use of correlated stimuli con serve as a kind of ``teaching'' input to the system to allow the development of feature detectors which would not develop otherwise. Although we find the competitive learning mechanism a very interesting and powerful learning principle, we do not, of course, imagine thot it is the only learning principle. Competitive learning is an essentially nonassociative statistical learning scheme. We certainly imagine that other kinds of learning mechanisms will be involved in the building of associations among patterns of activation in a more complete neural network. We offer this analysis of these competitive learning mechanisms to further our understanding of how simple adaptive networks can discover features important in the description of the stimulus environment in which the system finds itself.",

It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures, slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these a abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia act broadly to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary muscle activity.",

    abstract  = "A marked bias towards risk aversion has been observed in nearly every species tested. A minority of individuals, however, instead seem to prefer risk (repeatedly choosing uncertain large rewards over certain but smaller rewards), and even risk-averse individuals sometimes opt for riskier alternatives. It is not known how neural activity underlies such important shifts in decision-making—either as a stable trait across individuals or at the level of variability within individuals. Here we describe a model of risk-preference in rats, in which stable individual differences, trial-by-trial choices, and responses to pharmacological agents all parallel human behaviour. By combining new genetic targeting strategies with optical recording of neural activity during behaviour in this model, we identify relevant temporally specific signals from a genetically and anatomically defined population of neurons. This activity occurred within dopamine receptor type-2 (D2R)-expressing cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), signalled unfavourable outcomes from the recent past at a time appropriate for influencing subsequent decisions, and also predicted subsequent choices made. Having uncovered this naturally occurring neural correlate of risk selection, we then mimicked the temporally specific signal with optogenetic control during decision-making and demonstrated its causal effect in driving risk-preference. Specifically, risk-preferring rats could be instantaneously converted to risk-averse rats with precisely timed phasic stimulation of NAc D2R cells. These findings suggest that individual differences in risk-preference, as well as real-time risky decision-making, can be largely explained by the encoding in D2R-expressing NAc cells of prior unfavourable outcomes during decision-making.",

I illustrate this by an example from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent scientific definition of visual consciousness.

    abstract   = {It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} cells. It is shown that if about 10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification of typical archicortical cells is proposed.},

Adaptation has a rich history in psychophysics, where it is often used as a tool for dissecting the perceptual mechanisms of vision. Although we know comparatively little about the neurophysiological effects of adaptation, work in the last decade has revealed a rich repertoire of effects. This review focuses on this recent physiological work, the cellular and biophysical mechanisms that may underlie the observed effects, and the functional benefit that they may afford. I conclude with a brief discussion of some important open questions in the field.",

Their peculiar shape suggests that spines can serve as an autonomous postsynaptic compartment that isolates chemical and electrical signaling. How neuronal activity modifies the morphology of the spine and how these modifications affect synaptic transmission and plasticity are intriguing issues. Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine, respectively. This structural plasticity is mainly controlled by actin filaments, the principal cytoskeletal component of the spine. Here we review the pioneering microscopic studies examining the structural plasticity of spines and propose how changes in actin treadmilling might regulate spine morphology.",

Is there any systematic organization across the many diverse areas that comprise the PFC, or is it uniquely adaptive such that no fixed representational structure can develop? Going against the current tide, this paper argues that there is indeed a systematic organization across PFC areas, with an important functional distinction between ventral and dorsal regions characterized as processing What versus How information, respectively. This distinction has implications for the rostro-caudal and medial–lateral axes of organization as well. The resulting large-scale functional map of PFC could prove useful in integrating diverse data, and in generating novel predictions.",

We present a comprehensive framework spanning biological, computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical continuity between levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by extensive data at each level. Learning is based on making predictions about what the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and adapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex, driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed biophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a carefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of three pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central principles: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that drive the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized systematic invariant object representations of 100 different objects from simple movies, accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable predictions.",

The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.",

    abstract   = "William James noted that memories could persist from minutes to weeks. This essay attempts to explain this variation by situating the explanation in the biochemistry of dendritic spines. Two outcomes are critical to generate the synaptic basis of memory: (1) the actin cytoskeleton in the spine must be degraded to permit (2) additional AMPA receptors (GluA1s) to enter new ``hot spots'' in the postsynaptic density. These initial outcomes can support short-lasting memories. The threshold for these events is low but the underlying synaptic changes cannot resist the endocytic processes that remove the added AMPA receptors. For the memory to persist the degraded actin cytoskeleton must be rebuilt and the vacated ``hot spots'' refilled with GluA2 receptors. A primary claim is that it is the stabilization of an enlarged actin cytoskeleton that is the target outcome that consolidates the synaptic basis of memory (see Lynch et al., 2007). The stabilized actin cytoskeleton has properties that enable it to garner the synaptic proteins it needs to self sustain the potentiated state and to benefit from activation of memory modulation systems.\n\nThis article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brain and Memory.",

    abstract  = {Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent aspect of neuronal dynamics that shapes a neuron's signal processing properties on timescales ranging from about 10 ms to {$>$}1 s. For integrate-and-fire model neurons spike-frequency adaptation is incorporated either as an adaptation current or as a dynamic firing threshold. Whether a physiologically observed adaptation mechanism should be modeled as an adaptation current or a dynamic threshold, however, is not known. Here we show that a dynamic threshold has a divisive effect on the onset f\textendash{}I curve (the initial maximal firing rate following a step increase in an input current) measured at increasing mean threshold levels, i.e., adaptation states. In contrast, an adaptation current subtractively shifts this f\textendash{}I curve to higher inputs without affecting its slope. As a consequence, an adaptation current acts essentially linearly, resulting in a high-pass filter component of the neuron's transfer function for current stimuli. With a dynamic threshold, however, the transfer function strongly depends on the input range because of the multiplicative effect on the f\textendash{}I curves. Simulations of conductance-based spiking models with adaptation currents, such as afterhyperpolarization (AHP)-type, M-type, and sodium-activated potassium currents, do not show the divisive effects of a dynamic threshold, but agree with the properties of integrate-and-fire neurons with adaptation current. Notably, the effects of slow inactivation of sodium currents cannot be reproduced by either model. Our results suggest that, when lateral shifts of the onset f\textendash{}I curve are seen in response to adapting inputs, adaptation should be modeled with adaptation currents and not with a dynamic threshold. In contrast, when the slope of onset f\textendash{}I curves depends on the adaptation state, then adaptation should be modeled with a dynamic threshold. Further, the observation of divisively altered onset f\textendash{}I curves in adapted neurons with notable variability of their spike threshold could hint to yet known biophysical mechanisms directly affecting the threshold.},

We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names.

Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation, respectively.",

    abstract = "We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of the phasic dopamine signal- ing system that can account for a wider range of phenomena than simpler reward prediction error (RPE) accounts. The central feature of this PVLV framework is the distinction between a Primary Value (PV) system for anticipating the onset of primary rewards (USs), and a Learned Value (LV) system for learning about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system corresponds to the amygdala and its ability to drive phasic dopamine bursting in midbrain dopamine areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum (principally the nucleus accumbens, NAc), which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the lateral habenula, LHb). We show how our model can account for a range of data supporting the separability of these systems, including the non-zero- sum nature of CS and US firing, and individual differences in CS-based learning (sign-tracking) vs. US-based learning (goal-tracking). A critical feature of both systems is the use of opponent- processing pathways that represent the competing strengths of the evidence in favor and opposed to specific USs, and we show how these pathways can explain a range of important data dissociat- ing the processes involved in acquisition vs. extinction conditioning, including rapid reaquisition, reinstatement, and renewal. Furthermore, this opponent structure is critical for being able to ac- count for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the surprisingly closely-related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional separable pathways rep- resenting aversive USs, which largely mirror those for appetitive USs, also have some important differences from the positive valence case, which allow the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive conditioning. Overall, the ability to account for all of these phenomena strongly constrains the form of the model, which thus provides a well-validated framework for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.",

Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes ({$\pm$}2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

    abstract   = "The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation asserts that the induction of synaptic potentiation creates only the potential for a lasting change in synaptic efficacy, but not the commitment to such a change. Other neural activity, before or after induction, can also determine whether persistent change occurs. Recent findings, leading us to revise the original hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local, synapse-specific 'tagged' state and the expression of long-term potentiation are dissociable. Additional observations suggest that there are major differences in the mechanisms of functional and structural plasticity. These advances call for a revised theory that incorporates the specific molecular and structural processes involved. Addressing the physiological relevance of previous in vitro findings, new behavioural studies have experimentally translated the hypothesis to learning and the consolidation of newly formed memories.",

    title    = "Neural Signature of Hierarchically Structured Expectations Predicts Clustering and Transfer of Rule Sets in Reinforcement Learning",
    author   = "Collins, Anne Gabrielle Eva and Frank, Michael Joshua",
    abstract = "Often the world is structured such that distinct sensory contexts signify the same abstract rule set. Learning from feedback thus informs us not only about the value of stimulus-action associations but also about which rule set applies. Hierarchical clustering models suggest that learners discover structure in the environment, clustering distinct sensory events into a single latent rule set. Such structure enables a learner to transfer any newly acquired information to other contexts linked to the same rule set, and facilitates re-use of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Here, we show that humans exhibit this transfer, generalization and clustering during learning. Trial-by-trial model-based analysis of EEG signals revealed that subjects' reward expectations incorporated this hierarchical structure; these structured neural signals were predictive of behavioral transfer and clustering. These results further our understanding of how humans learn and generalize flexibly by building abstract, behaviorally relevant representations of the complex, high-dimensional sensory environment.",

    abstract  = "Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.",

    abstract   = "The laminar location of the cell bodies and terminals of interareal connections determines the hierarchical structural organization of the cortex and has been intensively studied. However, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the connectional principles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. Quantitative analysis of retrograde tracers was used to extend the notion that the laminar distribution of neurons interconnecting visual areas provides an index of hierarchical distance (percentage of supragranular labeled neurons [SLN]). We show that: 1) SLN values constrain models of cortical hierarchy, revealing previously unsuspected areal relations; 2) SLN reflects the operation of a combinatorial distance rule acting differentially on sets of connections between areas; 3) Supragranular layers contain highly segregated bottom-up and top-down streams, both of which exhibit point-to-point connectivity. This contrasts with the infragranular layers, which contain diffuse bottom-up and top-down streams; 4) Cell filling of the parent neurons of FF and FB pathways provides further evidence of compartmentalization; 5) FF pathways have higher weights, cross fewer hierarchical levels, and are less numerous than FB pathways. Taken together, the present results suggest that cortical hierarchies are built from supra- and infragranular counterstreams. This compartmentalized dual counterstream organization allows point-to-point connectivity in both bottom-up and top-down directions.",

Our Review suggests that the PRC and PHC\textendash{}RSC are core components of two separate large-scale cortical networks that are dissociable by neuroanatomy, susceptibility to disease and function.
