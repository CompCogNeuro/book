# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, Fourth Edition

This is the 4th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, motor control, learning, memory, language, and executive function.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the above-listed cognitive functions.

# Formats

Please use the following links to download the formatted version of the book:

* [PDF](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/releases/download/v1.0.0/ccnbook_ed4.pdf) --- best for printing

* [ePub](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/releases/download/v1.0.0/ccnbook_ed4.epub) --- opens in e.g., Mac iBooks

* [Kindle / MOBI](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/releases/download/v1.0.0/ccnbook_ed4.mobi) --- you can email this to yourself at your amazon kindle account to get it on your device: https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email

* [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com//dp/B007H9YWAG) --- you can pay $2.99 (lowest price possible) to have Amazon upload the book to your kindle, or roughly $35 for them to send you an on-demand paperback print version (in color)

* [HTML](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/releases/download/v1.0.0/ccnbook_ed4.html) --- single big HTML file --- NOTE: this does not display all of the math correctly, so you should use one of the other formats above for Chapters 2 and 4.

Note: if you click on `book` and the individual `.md` files in there (which is the raw source for the text), you can read the text but the figure captions will not show up, and there will be a `{ width }` styling tag after figures.

# Simulation Exercises

The simulation exercises that go with the book are available under this same organization in github, in the `sims` repository: https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/sims

These are updated with the new Go / Python version of *emergent*: https://github.com/emer/emergent

# Lecture Videos

Thanks to Covid-19, video lectures by O'Reilly @ UC Davis are being recorded: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu02O8xRZn7xtNx03Rlq6xMRdYcQgEpar)

# Citation

Please use this citation for the text:

(you could update year to 2020 but maybe better to just keep using the 2012 citation --- either way is fine)

# TODO

* ch7: fix bg description of da learning --- kinda buried
* ch7: update PVLV to latest bvPVLV version --- use pvlv readme?

* ch8: update theta, add pmn / atn stuff --- in general discussion is a bit disorganized and out-of-date.

* ch10: todo: nback model, hierarchical control model
