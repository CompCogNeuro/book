# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, Fifth Edition

This is the 5th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, motor control, learning, memory, language, and executive function.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the above-listed cognitive functions.
