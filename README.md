# ebook-template

## Overview

This repository is a template for a project that'll build an eBook (in
ePub, PDF, Microsoft Word and HTML form) from Markdown input files.

tl;dr: You write your book as a series of Markdown files, adhering to some
[file naming conventions](#book-source-file-names), and you run the `./build`
command (see [Building your book](#building-your-book)) to build your book.

There are sample files in this repository, so you can build a (completely
pointless and utterly useless) eBook right away.

This tooling has been tested with [Pandoc][] versions 2.0.4 and 2.0.5.

If you're impatient, jump to [Getting Started](#getting-started).

## What's where

- Your book's Markdown sources, cover image, and some metadata go in the
  `book` subdirectory. This is where you'll be doing your editing.

- The `files` subdirectory contains files used by the build. For instance, the
  HTML and ePub style sheets are there, as are LaTeX templates (used for PDF
  output) and a Microsoft Word style reference document. You shouldn't need to
  touch anything in `files`.

- The `scripts` subdirectory currently just contains a Pandoc filter used to
  provide [enhanced markup](#additional-markup). You shouldn't need to touch
  anything in `scripts`.

- The `lib` directory contains some additional Python code used by the build.
  Ignore it.

- Your book output files (`book.docx`, `book.epub`, `book.pdf` and
  `book.html`) are generated in the topmost directory.

- The build will also generate a subdirectory called `tmp` to hold some
  temporary files. Git is configured to ignore that directory.

## Supported output formats

This tooling will generate your book in the following formats:

### ePub

`book.epub`

ePub is the format used by Apple's iBooks and various free readers, including
[Calibre][].

### PDF
  
`book.pdf` is a single PDF document, generated by LaTeX or [Weasy Print][].

**Issues**:

- LaTeX PDF generation uses the LaTeX "article" document class, rather than the
  seemingly more suitable "book" class, because the "book" class, combined
  with Pandoc's LaTeX generation, is just a little too funky.
- Weasy Print-generated PDF has no table of contents.

### HTML

`book.html` is a single-page HTML, styled in a pleasant format.

### Microsoft Word

`book.docx` is a Microsoft Word version of your book.

**Issues:**

- There's no table of contents.
- The cover image is not included in the Word document.

## Unsupported formats

### Kindle (MOBI)

Pandoc can't generate books in Kindle format. However, there are several
options for generating Kindle content:
 
- Haul the Microsoft Word version into 
  [Kindle Create](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G202131100)

- Use the free and open source [Calibre][] suite to convert the ePub format to
  Kindle format.

## Getting started

Start by downloading and unpacking the latest
[release](https://github.com/bmc/ebook-template/releases) of this repository.
(By downloading a release, instead of cloning the repository, you can more
easily create your own Git repository from the results.)

Then, install the required software and update the configuration files.

### Can I use Docker? Why, yes!

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your machine, you can create
a Docker image to isolate them. Courtesy of
[@szaffarano](https://github.com/szaffarano), there's a `./build-docker`
script in the top-level directory. Just run it. (The first time you run it,
the script will build a Docker image with all the dependencies, which can
take some time.)

If you don't want to bother with Docker, just keep reading.

### Upgrading

If you're already using this tooling for one of your books, and you want to
upgrade to a newer version, the process (currently) is straightforward:

- Download and unpack the new version, as described above. Don't unpack it
  over your project!
- Run the new version's `upgrade.py` file from your project's top level
  directory.
- Run `./upgrade.py` from within your project, passing it the path to the
  unpacked new release.

For example:

```
cd /tmp
tar xf /path/to/downloaded/ebook-template-X.Y.Z.tgz
cd /path/to/your/ebook
/tmp/ebook-template-X.Y.Z/upgrade.py /tmp/ebook-template-X.Y.Z
```

Note that this copies files, removing ones that aren't necessary any more.
If there are metadata changes, however, `upgrade.py` won't apply them.
Be sure to read the change log for the new release.

### Required software

1. Install [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).
2. Install a Python distribution, version 3.6 or better.
    * On Mac OS, `brew install python3` will suffice.
    * On Ubuntu/Debian,
      [this article](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/332641/how-to-install-python-3-6)
      might help.
    * On Windows, see <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>.
3. I recommend creating and activating a
   [Python virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/),
   to keep the installed version of Python 3 more or less pristine.
4. Once you have your Python 3 environment set up (and activated, if you're
   using a virtual environment), install the required Python packages with
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. You can generate PDF via either LaTeX or [Weasy Print][]. There are
   advantages and disadvantages to each; see [Generating PDF](#generating-pdf),
   below.
    * If you'll be using LaTeX, install a TexLive distribution, as detailed
      [below](installing-texlive).
    * If you'll be using [Weasy Print][], make sure your Python 3 environment
      is activated, and follow the directions at 
      <http://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>

#### Installing TexLive

* On Mac OS, use [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html),
  and ensure that `/Library/TeX/texbin` is in your path.
* On Ubuntu/Debian, install `texlive`, `texlive-latex-recommended` and
  `texlive-latex-extras`.
* On Windows, this might work: <https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html>.


**WARNING**: I avoid Windows as much as possible. I do not (and, likely,
never will) test this stuff on Windows. If you insist on using that platform,
you're more or less on your own.

### Initial configuration

#### Create your cover image

In your `book` directory, create a cover image, as a PNG. If you haven't
settled on a cover image yet, you can use the dummy image that's already
there. **Currently, the cover image is not optional.**

#### Fill in the metadata

Edit `book/metadata.yaml`, and fill in the relevant pieces. Both Pandoc
and the build tooling use this metadata.

**Note**: This file contains 
[Pandoc YAML Metadata](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block),
with some additional fields used by this build tooling.

The following elements are _required_.

- `title` (**Required**): The book title.

- `subtitle` (**Optional**): Subtitle, if any.

- `author` (**Required**): A YAML list of authors. If there is only one author, use a 
  single-element YAML list. For example:
  
```yaml
author:
- Joe Horrid
```

```yaml
author:
- Joe Horrid
- Frances Horrid
```

- `copyright` (**Required**): A block with two required fields, `owner` and
  `year`. See the existing sample `metadata.yaml` for an example.
  
- `publisher` (**Required**): The publisher of the book.

- `language` (**Required**): The language in which the book is written. The
  value can be a 2-letter [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) 
  code, such as "en" or "fr". It can also be a 2-part string consisting
  of the ISO 639-1 language code and the 2-letter
  [ISO 3166](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13214_01/wli/docs92/xref/xqisocodes.html)
  country code, such as "en-US", "en-UK", "fr-CA", "fr-FR", etc.

- `genre` (**Required**): The book's genre. See
  <https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Genre> for a list of genres.

#### Edit the copyright information

Edit the `book/copyright.md` file. You can leave `%` tokens in there; they'll
be substituted as described, below, in [Additional markup](#additional-markup).
The meaning of the `{<}` is also explained in that section.

## Markup notes

Your book will use Markdown, as interpreted by Pandoc. The following Pandoc
extensions are enabled. See the
[Pandoc User's Guide][] for full details.

- `line_blocks`: Use vertical bars to create lines that are formatted as is.
  See <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#line-blocks> for details.

- `escaped_line_breaks`: A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard
  line break.
  See <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-escaped_line_breaks> for details.

- `yaml_metadata_block`: Allows metadata in the Markdown. See
  See <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block> for details.

- `smart`: Interprets straight quotes as curly quotes, "---" as em-dashes, 
  "--" as en-dashes, and "..." as ellipses. Nonbreaking spaces are inserted 
  after certain abbreviations, such as "Mr.". See
  <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-smart> for details.
  
- `backtick_code_blocks`, `fenced_code_blocks` and `fenced_code_attributes`: 
  Allows fenced code blocks, using backticks (GitHub Flavored Markdown-style) 
  and tildes (`~~~`). You can also supply attributes (classes, for instance). 
  See <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_code_blocks>,
  <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_code_attributes> and 
  <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-backtick_code_blocks> for details.


### Additional markup

The build tool uses a [Pandoc filter](https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters)
(in `scripts/pandoc-filter.py`) to enrich the Markdown slightly:

1. Level 1 headings denote new chapters and force a new page.
2. If you want to force a new page without starting a new chapter, just
   include an empty level-1 header (`#`). See `book/copyright-template.md` 
   for an example.
3. A paragraph containing just the line `+++` is replaced by a centered line
   containing "• • •". This is a useful separator.
4. A paragraph that starts with `{<}` followed by at least one space is
   left-justified. See `book/copyright-template.md` for an example.
5. A paragraph that starts with `{>}` followed by at least one space is
   right-justified.
6. A paragraph that starts with `{|}` followed by at least one space is
   centered.

Note, too, that Pandoc automatically converts your quotation marks into
smart quotes, triple dots (`...`) into an ellipsis, and two dashes (`--`)
into an em-dash.

(The filter is written in Python, using the
[Panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/) package.)

### Support for PlantUML

If you set `use_plantuml` to `true` in your metadata, you can use 
[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) diagrams in your book, using special
fenced code blocks. For instance:

```
~~~plantuml
@startuml
client->server: SYN
server->client: SYN+ACK
client->server: ACK
@enduml
~~~
```

You can use either tildes or backticks, and you can also use Pandoc-style
fenced code blocks to supply attributes. If you specify an "alt" attribute
or a "title" attribute, it will be used as the title for the image (for
readers that display the title). If you specify both, "title" is preferred.
For example:

```
~~~ {.plantuml title="4-way handshake"}
@startuml
client->server: FIN
server->client: ACK
server->client: FIN
client->server: ACK
@enduml
~~~
```

Chapter 1 of the sample book contains these two examples.


## Book source file names

The tooling expects your book's Markdown sources to be in the `book`
subdirectory and to adhere to the following conventions:

- All files must have the extension `.md`.

- If you create a file called `dedication.md`, it'll be placed right after the
  copyright page in the generated output. See `dedication.md` for an example.
  If you don't want a dedication, simply delete the provided `dedication.md`.

- If your book has a foreward, just create file `foreward.md`, and it'll
  be inserted right after the dedication. Otherwise, just delete the supplied
  sample `foreward.md`.

- If your book has a preface, just create file `preface.md`, and it'll
  be inserted right after the foreward. Otherwise, just delete the supplied
  sample `preface.md`.

- If the book has a prologue, put it in file `prologue.md`. It'll appear
  before the first chapter. If you don't want a prologue, simply delete the
  provided `prologue.md`.

- Keep each chapter in a separate file. (This is easier for editing, source
  control, etc.) Name the files `chapter-NN.md`. For instance,
  `chapter-01.md`, `chapter-02.md`, etc. The chapter files are sorted
  lexically, so the leading zeros are necessary if you have more than 9
  chapters. If you have more than 100 chapters (_seriously?_), just add
  another leading zero (e.g., `chapter-001.md`). If you _must_ put the entire
  content in one file, the file's name must start with `chapter-` and end in
  `.md`.
 
- If the book has an epilogue, put it in file `epilogue.md`. It'll follow the
  last chapter. If you don't want an epilogue, simply delete the provided
  `epilogue.md`.

- If you create a file called `acknowledgments.md`, it'll be placed after the
  epilogue. If you don't want an acknowledgements chapter, simply delete the
  provided `acknowledgments.md`.

- If you need one or more appendices, just create files that start with
  `appendix-` and end with `.md`. Note that the files are sorted lexically.
  There are sample appendix files in `book`; delete them if you don't want
  any appendices.

- If you plan to provide a glossary, create `glossary.md`. If you don't need
  a glossary, delete the provided sample file.

- If you want to include an author biography, just create `author.md`.

- If you need a references (bibliography) section, create `references.yaml`,
  as described below. If you don't need a bibliography section, just delete
  the provided sample `references.yaml`.
  
**NOTE**: There's currently no support for generating an index.

### Summary of chapter ordering

- title page
- dedication (if present)
- foreward (if present)
- preface (if present)
- prologue (if present)
- all chapters
- epilogue (if present)
- acknowledgments (if present)
- appendices (if present)
- glossary (if present)
- author (if present)
- references (if present)

### Generating PDF

You can generate PDF via either LaTeX or [Weasy Print][].

| PDF engine  | Advantages | Disadvantages
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------
| LaTeX       | rich typesetting, table of contents | LaTeX fonts aren't supported by all printers
| Weasy Print | good printer font support | no table of contents 

### Images

Image references to files are relative to the _top_ directory, not to the
`book` directory. It's best to stick with PNG images.

### Table of contents

- **PDF**: If you're using LaTeX, Pandoc automatically generates the table of 
  contents in the PDF. If you're using Weasy Print, there's no table of 
  contents.

- **ePub**: Pandoc generates the table of contents as part of the ePub package.

- **HTML**: The build tool includes JavaScript that generates a table
  of contents in the browser.

- **Word**: Pandoc doesn't generate a table of contents for Microsoft Word,
  because it's trivial to create your own. In newer versions of Microsoft
  Word (e.g., the version you get with Office 365):
    - Insert a page break to create a new, blank page.
    - Select "References" from the menu bar.
    - Select "Table of Contents", and select your desired style.
  
### Bibliographic references

If you're writing a book that needs a bibliography _and_ uses citations in
the text, there's a bit of extra work.

First, install [`pandoc-citeproc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc).

- On Mac OS, use `brew install pandoc-citeproc`.
- On Ubuntu/Debian, it should have been installed when you installed `pandoc`.
- On Windows, it should have been installed when you installed `pandoc`.

Next, you'll need to create the bibliography YAML file,
`book/references.yaml`, suitably organized for `pandoc` to consume. The sample
`book/references.yaml` contains a single entry. You can hand-code this file,
or you can use `pandoc-citeproc` to generate it from an existing bibliographic
file (e.g., a BibTeX file).

See the [citations section][] in the Pandoc User's Guide and the
[`pandoc-citeproc` man page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md)
for more details.

**NOTE**: The presence of a `book/references.yaml` file triggers the build
tooling to include a **References** chapter, to which `pandoc` will add any
cited works. Your bibliography (`book/references.yaml`) can contain as many
references as you want; only the ones you actually cite in your text will show
up in the References section. If your text contains no citations, the
References section will be empty. The build tooling does _not_ check first to
see whether you actually have any citations in your text.

An example of a citation is:

```
[See @WatsonCrick1953]
```

Again, see the [citations section][] of the [Pandoc User's Guide][] for
full details.

## Styling your book

The ePub styling uses `files/epub.css`, and the HTML is styled with
`files/html.css`.

You can change the styling by providing your own version of those files
in the `book` directory. That is:

- If `book/html.css` exists, it will be used instead of `files/html.css`.
- If `book/epub.css` exists, it will be used instead of `files/epub.css`.

## Building your book

Once you've prepared everything, as described above, you can rebuild the
book by running the command:

```
./build
```

`./build` is a Python script using the Python [doit](http://pydoit.org/)
build tool. You should not need to edit it; editing `metadata.yaml` is
sufficient to specify the information about your book.

### Other useful build targets

- `./build version`: Show what version of this tooling you have.
- `./build docx`: Build just the Microsoft Word version of the book.
- `./build pdf`: Build just the PDF version of the book.
- `./build epub`: Build just the ePub version of the book.
- `./build html`: Build just the HTML version of the book.

You can combine targets:

```
./build docx pdf
```

### Cleaning up generated files

To clean up the built targets:

```
./build clean
```

To clean _everything_ out (except `doit-db.json`, which won't go away):

```
./build clobber
```

### Auto-building

Because `./build` is a [doit][] script, it supports _auto-building_. If you
run it as follows:

```
./build auto
```

it will build your book (if it's not up-to-date), then wait; any time one or
more of the source Markdown files changes, it will automatically rebuild your
book. To stop it, just hit Ctrl-C.

**NOTE**: Auto-building will _not_ detect the addition of new files. For
instance, if you're running in auto-build mode, and you add a new
`chapter-03.md` file, the build script will _not_ detect it. You'll have to
kill the auto-build and restart it.

### Gotchas

But that doesn't _always_ work as expected. For instance, from traditional
_make_(1) usage, you might expect `build clean pdf` to run the "clean" target,
_then_ run the "pdf" target. Instead, it _just_ runs the "clean" operation for
the PDF. (That's a [doit][] quirk.)
